Drug consumption remains a global issue for its detrimental effect on an individual’s clinical and mental health. Various factors contributing to initial drug use include psychological, economic, individual, environmental, and social factors, all of which are associated with several personality traits. Personality traits are people’s characteristic patterns of feelings, thoughts, and behaviours. Researchers have used personality traits to develop predictive drug risk assessment models.

Utilizing machine learning in various behavioural health conditions has demonstrated to be beneficial in the (i) detection and diagnosis of behavioural health disorder symptoms [1], (ii) prediction of risk levels and (iii) gaining in-depth understanding of behavioural health disorders [2]. Employing ML is motivated by the reasoning that data-driven behavioural risk assessment tools remove barriers of access to care, are inexpensive, are more objective and reduce social stigma, resulting in improved clinical practices and decision making [2];[3].

Specifically, for drug use disorder, machine learning methods have recently been implemented for a variety of predictive applications which include detecting current drug use, evaluating future risk and predicting treatment success [4]. Mostly it is enough to focus on prediction performance, but sometimes it is necessary to go beyond simply knowing “what” is being predicted to knowing “why” the prediction was made and be able to interpret the decision [5]. This is especially useful for clinical applications where an interpretable ML model explains why certain predictions or decisions are made, enabling a better understanding of the condition. In that case, the model itself becomes a source of knowledge instead of the data, which can be captured by interpretability. In the context of drug abuse, by interpreting why a prediction was made, it is possible to know the most significant personality traits specific to each drug, which can serve as a biomarker i.e. biological parameters that help in assessing symptoms. Similar to how the human body has physical biomarkers such as blood cholesterol for diagnosing coronary heart disease, it has behavioural biomarkers for conditions like drug abuse that relate back to personality traits of an individual. This makes it possible to identify patterns of drug dependence in individuals and determine relevant sub-types of different disorders to provide treatments that are most suited for a particular individual [6].
